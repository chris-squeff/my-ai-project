# LaunchPad

## Project Overview

An AI-powered campaign planning assistant that helps digital marketers generate complete ad campaign structures across Meta, Google, and TikTok. Users input their budget, goals, and a brief description, and the tool generates keywords, interest targeting suggestions, headlines, and ad copy variations—reducing campaign setup time from hours to minutes.

### Target Customer
Digital marketers and media buyers managing paid campaigns across multiple platforms (Meta, Google, TikTok), particularly those working with B2B clients in creative industries like music, entertainment, and tech. These are professionals or small agency owners who handle 5-15 campaigns monthly, need to present polished campaign plans to clients, and want to reduce time spent on repetitive campaign setup tasks.

### Value Proposition
Speed and presentation quality. What takes 2-4 hours of manual research and results in a cluttered Google Sheet now takes 5 minutes and produces a polished, visual campaign plan that clients actually want to review. Marketers get AI-powered targeting suggestions across Meta, Google, and TikTok in one place instead of switching between multiple platform dashboards. The tool learns campaign structure patterns and generates professional-looking plans that improve client approval rates and make marketers look more strategic. It's the difference between showing up to a client meeting with a spreadsheet versus a designed strategy document.

## Development Guidelines

When working on this project:

1. **Start with Context**: Always review the relevant sections of the PRD before implementing features
2. **Follow the Plan**: The implementation plan outlines the recommended development sequence
3. **Reference User Stories**: Each feature should map to user stories in the PRD
4. **Maintain Alignment**: Technical decisions should align with the architecture in the implementation plan

## Current Focus

The MVP focuses on these core capabilities:

- Campaign brief input form (budget, goal, target audience, product/service description)
- AI-powered campaign structure generator using Claude API
- Multi-platform keyword generation (Google/YouTube Ads with 10-15 variations)

See `confabulator/implementation-plan.md` for the complete development roadmap.

## Important Notes

- This is a web application
- All generated documentation is in the `confabulator/` directory
- The PRD contains the definitive feature requirements
- The implementation plan provides the technical roadmap
